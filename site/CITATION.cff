  Phase-coherent GNSS clock analysis across independent centers (IGS, ESA, CODE) 
  with distance-correlation methods; publication-ready research site and analysis package.
  We report distance-structured correlations in GNSS clock products using phase-coherent 
  analysis across 62.7M station-pair measurements, finding exponential correlation lengths 
  of 3,330â€“4,549 km consistent with screened scalar-field models.
