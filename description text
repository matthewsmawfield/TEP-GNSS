Global Time Echoes: Experimental evidence for Temporal Equivalence Principle via GNSS atomic clock correlations. Analysis of 62.7M measurements reveals distance-structured correlations (λ = 3,330-4,549 km) and extraordinary planetary gravitational-temporal field coupling (r = -0.440, p = 2.08×10⁻⁴⁸).

Zenodo Description: 
Observations of exponentially decaying correlations in GNSS atomic clocks reveal characteristic lengths λ = 3,330-4,549 km across IGS, ESA, and CODE products. Phase-coherent analysis of 62.7 million station-pair measurements using phase-coherent spectral methods (10-500 μHz) yields strong exponential fits (R² = 0.920-0.970) and passes rigorous validation including 27-29× null test signal destruction, 16.2× bias characterization separation, and ionospheric independence confirmation (r = -0.122 to -0.129 with space weather indices). Comprehensive gravitational-temporal field correlation analysis using NASA/JPL DE440/441 ephemeris reveals extraordinary anti-phase correlations (r = -0.440, p = 2.08×10⁻⁴⁸) between stacked planetary influences and temporal field coherence, with distinct individual planetary signatures: Jupiter (r = -0.257), Sun (r = -0.227), Mars (r = -0.106). Eclipse analysis across 5 events (294,572 station pairs) demonstrates dynamic field responses, while orbital periodicity analysis reveals systematic TEP signals correlated with orbital completeness (Venus: ESA +17.7%, IGS +10.6%). Helical motion analysis detects Earth's complex spiral trajectory through spacetime via five complementary methods: Chandler wobble signatures (r = 0.635-0.844), temporal-orbital coupling (r = -0.512 to -0.638), 3D spherical harmonic decomposition (CV ≈ 1.0), multi-frequency beat patterns, and Coherent Network Dynamics ("Mesh Dance") (score = 0.635-0.636). These findings provide compelling experimental evidence for Temporal Equivalence Principle predictions, demonstrating the GPS network acts as a sensitive detector of gravitational-temporal field coupling and spacetime's dynamic geometry.
