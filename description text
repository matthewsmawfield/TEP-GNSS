Global Time Echoes: Distance-structured correlations in GNSS clocks (λ = 3,330-4,549 km) with comprehensive helical motion analysis. Complete analysis of 62.7M measurements across CODE/IGS/ESA centres reveals Chandler wobble, beat frequencies, and coherent network dynamics.

Zenodo Description: 
Observations of exponentially decaying correlations in GNSS atomic clocks reveal characteristic lengths λ = 3,330-4,549 km across IGS, ESA, and CODE products. Phase-coherent analysis of 62.7 million station-pair measurements using band-limited spectral methods (10-500 μHz) yields strong exponential fits (R² = 0.920-0.970) and passes rigorous null tests. Comprehensive helical motion analysis detects Earth's complex motion signatures via five complementary methods: Chandler wobble detection (r = 0.635-0.844), 3D spherical harmonic decomposition (CV ≈ 1.0), multi-frequency beat patterns, relative motion dynamics, and coherent network dynamics (score = 0.635-0.636). These findings are consistent with Temporal Equivalence Principle predictions for screened scalar field coupling to atomic frequencies.
