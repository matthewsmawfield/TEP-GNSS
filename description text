Global Time Echoes: Distance-structured correlations in GNSS clocks (λ = 3,330-4,549 km) with revolutionary helical motion analysis detecting Earth's spiral trajectory through spacetime. Complete analysis of 62.7M measurements across CODE/IGS/ESA centres reveals Chandler wobble, beat frequencies, and coherent "mesh dance" signatures.

Zenodo Description: 
Observations of exponentially decaying correlations in GNSS atomic clocks reveal characteristic lengths λ = 3,330-4,549 km across IGS, ESA, and CODE products. Phase-coherent analysis of 62.7 million station-pair measurements using band-limited spectral methods (10-500 μHz) yields strong exponential fits (R² = 0.920-0.970) and passes rigorous null tests. Revolutionary helical motion analysis detects Earth's complex spiral trajectory through spacetime via five complementary methods: Chandler wobble signatures (r = 0.635-0.844), 3D spherical harmonic decomposition (CV ≈ 1.0), multi-frequency beat patterns, relative motion dynamics, and coherent network "mesh dance" (score = 0.635-0.636). These findings align with Temporal Equivalence Principle predictions, suggesting the GPS network acts as humanity's first operational detector of spacetime's dynamic geometry. Complete code and data analysis pipeline provided for reproducibility.
