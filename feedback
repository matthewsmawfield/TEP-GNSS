Summary of Issues and Pipeline Goals
Current Issues
Inconsistent Station Counts: We've reported wildly different numbers (1,300+ → 589 → 343 → 380 → 990 → 395), creating confusion and undermining credibility.
9-char vs 4-char Station ID Confusion:
Raw CLK files contain 725 unique 9-character RINEX v3 identifiers
These collapse to 426 unique 4-character site codes for distance calculations
Only 395 of those 426 sites have valid coordinates in our catalogue
Key Question: Are 9-char variants at the same 4-char site co-located (same physical location) or different clocks/antennas that should be treated separately?
Clock Metadata Complexity: Station equipment changes over time, making clock-type separation methodologically problematic and not essential for the core TEP analysis.
Missing Coordinates: 31 stations (27 CODE + 4 ESA) appear in processed data but lack coordinates in our catalogue.
Pipeline Cleanliness: Scattered scripts, inconsistent validation, and unclear data flow make the analysis hard to reproduce and publish.
What We Need to Achieve
Perfect Pipeline Requirements:
Authoritative Station Count: One definitive, verifiable number per analysis center and overall, with clear documentation of:
Raw 9-char identifiers per center
Unique 4-char sites per center
Sites with valid coordinates (actually analyzed)
Spatial verification that 9-char → 4-char mapping is valid
Clean Data Flow:
Step 1: Download raw data + build complete coordinate catalogue
Step 2: Validate coordinates + audit station identifiers
Steps 3-7: Analysis with consistent station counts throughout
Spatial Validation: Verify that multiple 9-char IDs mapping to the same 4-char site are:
Co-located (< 100m separation) → Safe to merge for distance analysis
OR spatially separated → Should be treated as distinct stations
Complete Coordinate Recovery: Resolve the 31 missing coordinates through authoritative sources (IGS, BKG, EPN).
Reproducible Documentation: Every number in the manuscript/website traceable to specific pipeline outputs with clear methodology.
Next Steps:
Run the station ID audit to verify 9-char → 4-char spatial co-location
Based on results, either confirm 395 stations analyzed or adjust methodology
Update all text with final, verified numbers
Ensure pipeline runs cleanly from Step 1 → Step 7 with consistent counts
The core issue is data integrity and reproducibility - we need bulletproof station counting that can withstand peer review.
